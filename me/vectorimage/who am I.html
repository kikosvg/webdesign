    <h1>Who am I</h1>
    <div style="background-color:aqua">
    <p id="p1">I was born in Japan, lived in Beijing until I was 14, and then moved to Boston. So I'm very good at being an international student and finding a comfortable place to sleep at the airport. And now that I'm in New York, I'm gradually getting to like the city <strong>(except for the subway)</strong>. The noisy and bustling place suits my personality very well. Most of the time I'm very noisy (according to my friends), but there are also times when I just want to sit in the park and watch the sunset.<img src="https://img2.baidu.com/it/u=837181999,3770893190&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG?w=750&h=500" width="500" alt="Something like that"></p>

    <h2>Why i choose this course</h2>
<p>Last year, I had a dream of starting a business and wanted to set up an <a href="https://www.gorjana.com/collections/bracelets?srsltid=AfmBOorZ-U6NZk384kvc07r-N1NgcU3qly-YN32hZf9L9313CIFdox8p">online independent website</a> to sell some necklaces and bracelets. However, due to technical problems, I could only try to use the online independent website editor, which was very difficult to use and charged extremely high fees. So this year, I want to try to learn on my own!</p>
